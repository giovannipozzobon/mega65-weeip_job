WeeIP for the MEGA65.

Changes copyright 2020-2022 Paul Gardner-Stephen (paul@m-e-g-a.org)

Includes several example programmes:

haustierbegriff -- A PETSCII Terminal programme for connecting to BBSs
fetch -- A simple HTTP-protocol file fetcher for the MEGA65

Notes:
* Uses the MEGA65's 100mbit fast ethernet controller.
* Generally munged to behave correctly under CC65.
* Fixed several bugs in the original WeeIP, including a nasty one in checksum calculation.
* Simple DHCP and DNS clients now included.
* Work in progress, and not yet usable.

WeeIP is a simple but complete working transport-network protocol stack for 8-bit microprocessors.
Its current version supports Microchip PIC18Fx7J60 family of microcontrollers, but it can be easily ported to other architectures.

Some features:
* Both TCP and UDP protocols supported
* ARP address resolution incorporated
* Multiple socket support, both client and server
* Lightweight, small foot-print code
* Specially targeted for 8-bit microprocessors
* Easy to learn API, based on the SOCKET opaque structure
* Event-driven design pattern makes it easy to integrate with existing applications
